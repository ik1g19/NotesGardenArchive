#### Describe the differences between block-level and inline-level elements in HTML

Block level elements create a new line or block on the page and take up the full width available

e.g.
- `<div>`
- `<h1>`
- `<p>`

Inline-level elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary

e.g.
- `<span>`
- `<a>`
- `<img>`

# Pooling Layer

The purpose of a pooling layer is to reduce the size, but not the depth, of the feature map generated by the preceding convolution.

A pooling layer retains the RGB information but compresses the spatial information.

The reason we do this is to enable kernels to focus selectively on certain nonlinear features

There are three major reasons why pool layers are used to reduce dimensions of the output feature map:
- Reduces computational load by discarding irrelevant features
- Smaller number of parameters, so less likely to overfit data
- Able to extract features that are transformed in some way, for example images of an object from different perspectives

# Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent networks are different in that they accept a sequence, of arbitrary size, as the input and produce a sequence as output.

Moreover, the internal state of the network's hidden layers is updated as a result of a learned function and the input.

In this way, a recurrent network remembers its state.

Subsequent states are a function of previous states

title: "CV Notes from Audioscenic"
---

- Two page CV is better than fitting content to fit onto one page
- Read and understand the tone of the job description and employer
	- The tone of your CV should match their tone
- It is not necessary to meet all of the required skills, it is okay to have holes in those areas
- If you have skills and requirements from the job description, make sure to include them in your CV
- When tailoring to the job description, your sections and items can follow the same order as the job description, as they will be looking through the job description as  a checklist
- A notable projects section would be good, items do not need to be listed necessarily in chronological order, rather the importance and relevance of the project
- Highlighting and emboldening relevant skills in blocks of text is useful
- Print off your CV and turn it upside down, the different sections in the CV should still be obvious
- Feel free to still mention important/relevant GCSEs/A Levels
	- E.g. Computer Science/Maths
- Demonstrating good formatting and presentation skills is important, or organisation skills - as these are often skills they are looking for in the job description
